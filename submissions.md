**Anonymization**  
The ProbNum25 review process is double-blind. All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information that can violate the double-blind reviewing policy, such as the author names or their affiliations, acknowledgements, or links that can infer any author’s identity or institution. Self-citations are allowed as long as anonymity is preserved.

**Confidentiality**  
Reviewer will be instructed to keep them confidential during the review process and delete them once the review process has concluded.


## Reviewer nomination
For each submission, the authors will be expected to nominate at least one of the authors as a reviewer for ProbNum25. Nominated reviewers are expected to have sufficient expertise in the relevant field.
