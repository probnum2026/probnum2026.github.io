title: 'ProbNum25'
---

ProbNum is a gathering of researchers working on algorithms that quantify or utilize computational uncertainty, i.e. the error arising when a mathematical task is performed on a discrete computer in finite time. Of particular interest are numerical algorithms for use within machine learning; artificial intelligence; scientific simulation, and computational statistics, due to these communities' innate interest in uncertainty quantification. 

The goal of the meeting is an open exchange of ideas, aiming to embrace computational uncertainty to make computations faster, more reliable, and easier to design and use. 

# About

ProbNum25 will be held at EURECOM in [Sophia Antipolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Antipolis) near Nice, France from 1-3 September 2025.
The event is open to all. We expect to open registrations on **14th May 2025**.

As our community grows, we are moving towards a broader conference format: ProbNum25 will have a proceedings; you can find more details about this [here](/submissions.html).
